# PixelTrails
An experimental animated landscape built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Includes time-based scene transitions (day/night), parallax-style moving scenery, a custom animated cursor with click sparkles, sound effects, and a pixel-style walking character. A creative playground for front-end visuals.
